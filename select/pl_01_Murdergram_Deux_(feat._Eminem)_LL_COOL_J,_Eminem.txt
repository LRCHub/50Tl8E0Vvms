Do you remember first time
you heard the legend in leather
The career ended with the road
killin stuck to his fender
I'm on another bender
Dunk off the power
to make a coward surrender
As I devour contenders
Talking foul to whoever
Your head is bout to get severed
And then I bounce it
with pleasure
I'm pouring out Amaretto
Homies I won't forget them
So tap the bottle and pour it
Super models I ignore em
Later on it's like porn
reincarnation of the ripper
I give stitches
and chest zippers
Cinderellas get propellers out
they glass slippers
Time is ticking giving ass
Whipping how we keep the cash
Flipping
I can't understand a single word
you're saying
I think you have syrup brain
"Bout to finish you
like polyurethane
All that Molly probably sure
to drain your spinal fluid
from your vertebrae
This the murdergram
and I brought my murder game
My shit fire that is why
you log on it like duraflame
And as far as boulevards
I'm talkin about farmers
like insurance claims
I just blew your girl away
But she on so much blow
and lean I call that fuckin hoe
Katrina somebody better
give her a cane (hurricane)
And that's on everythang
She loves my heavy chain
My yellow diamonds shining
got her whipping
like lemon murrain
She strippin in front the gang
she slipping inside of the range
She quick to go out with a bang
it's like I throw out a Grenade
Once you the pull the pin
That's when the killing
will begin you feel me
Pulling off you your skin
I really came to get it
in deliver
Murdergrams turn over
your ambulance
30 bullets in advance
candlelight and crying fans
We gonna win it by a land
slide up behind you
Testing my rifle give blessing
to my disciples professional
I'm a sniper from 8 miles
away me and Marshall doing
murders with dirty burners
Break em down and melt em
in the furnace
Unapologetic and we gonna
cause a headache
Me and L about to set it
we about to murder gram it
Any one ya all can get it
So you might as well forget it
either way you will regret it
cemetery's were you headed
The message in the chorus
You bastards got nothing for us
The overlord is rawest
I ain't talking about
a rent a car
When I'm pulling the Taurus
Its Halloween them candy bars'll
get you killed in the forest
We are lyrically lawless
Stacking money
Hoarders
Slugs'll make you forget
all slick ass shit that
you thought of
Blow your mind
with the sawed off
Just when you thought
it was safe we busting at you
from the wraith
Then hitting a donut ain't
nothing sweet when we come
in the place
When I say you ain't fuckin
with moi I do not mean
kisses blew
But I got the potential to
fuckin flip when I'm mentioned
with a penchant to
Come back with a vengeance
like Jack the Ripper to rip
it just giving you
A sample a fucking snippet
(snip it) like scissors do
know when I hit the booth
I think of the days of old
when I was quick to fool
Used to fly off the handle
like a fuckin witches broom
I called it pluckin flowers
cause I was so quick to pick
a tool up like it's petunias
Sick medulla
But thanks to Cool J
he created a monster
Spaghetti sauce and mozzarella
on a tray full of pasta
You got a couple of
motherfuckin trained killers
on ya (lasagna)
And I'm just being
as Frank as Sinatra
When I be sayin that I'ma keep
this shit gangsta as mobsters
But when you got fanatics going
so crazy they mob ya
Lookin like organized crime
because you can't get em
off of ya (mafia)
And all your motherfuckin
enemies they wanna off ya
Like Hoffa and dump your body
in Lake Minnetonka
That's how you know you
fuckin saw and you came
and you conquered
Veni Vidi Vici Stomping
and making them bonkers
Now women treat me like BDK
the king and they feed me grapes
Either way
I got more on my plate
than an all you can eat buffet
So better pick a B.C. date
because your history as Shady
is a-bout to set it on
you like a TV tray man
I see the way
People say I'm so evil
they fuckin think that
Timothy McVeigh
And my DNA are exactly the same
but when I leave this game
Things just ain't
gonna be the same
But it's in need of change
and I'm the meter maid
Go ahead crack a bottle
Cause this is EJ
Meaning me and James
Got that avocado
And we the sociopaths
and we got your hoe on our laps
And we're going back to Cali
so she can blow on our sax
