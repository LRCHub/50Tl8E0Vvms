Do you remember first time you heard the legend in leather?
The career ender with the road-killer stuck to his fender
I'm on another bender, drunk off the power that make a coward surrender as I devour contenders
Talkin' foul of whoever, your head is 'bout to get severed
Then I bounce it with pleasure, I'm pourin' out Amaretto
Homies, I won't forget 'em, so tap the bottle and pour it
Supermodels I ignore 'em, later on it's like porn
Reincarnation of the ripper, I give stitches and chest zippers
Cinderella's get propellered out their glass slippers
Time is tickin', givin' ass whoppin's how we keep the cash flippin'
What? A supa-dupa switch (what?)
I can't understand a single word you're sayin'
I think you have syrup brain, 'bout to finish you like polyurethane
All that molly probably sure to drain your spinal fluid from your vertebrae
This the Murdergram and I brought my murder gang
My shit fire, that is why you log on it like Duraflame
But as far as boulevards, I'm talkin' 'bout Farmers like insurance claims (pfft)
I just blew your girl away, but she on so much blow and lean (what?)
I call that fuckin' ho Katrina, somebody better give her-a-cane (Hurricane)
And that's on everything (what?), she love my heavy chain
My yellow diamond shinin', got her whippin' like lemon meringue
Strippin' in front of the gang, she's slippin' inside of the Range
Quick to go out with a bang, it's like I threw out a grenade
Once you pull up in this, when the killin' will begin
You feel me pullin' off your skin, I really came to get it and deliver
Murdergrams, turn over your ambulance, thirty bullets in advance
Candlelight and cryin' fans, we go in and buy a land
Slide up behind you, testin' my rifle
Give blessings to my disciples, professional I'm a sniper
Like eight miles away, me and Marshall doin' murders
With dirty burners, break them down and melt them in the furnace
Unapologetic and we're gonna cause a headache
Me and L about to set it, we about to murdergram it
Anyone of y'all can get it, so you might as well forget it
Either way you will regret it, cemetery's where you're headed
Come on (yeah)
The message in the chorus, you bastards got nothin' for us
The overlord is the rawest, I ain't talkin' 'bout a rental car
When I'm pullin' the Taurus, this Halloween
Them candy bars'll get you killed in the forest
We are lyrically lawless, stackin' money, hoarders
Slugs that make you forget all that slick-ass shit that you thought of
Blow your mind with the sawed off
Just when you thought it was safe, we bustin' at you from the Wraith
They hittin' the door in, ain't nothin' sweet when we come in to play
When I say that you ain't fuckin' with moi (mwah)
I do not mean kisses, boo, but I got the potential to
Fuckin' flip what I mention with a pinchin' tool (what?)
Come back with vengeance like Jack the Ripper
To rip it, just givin' you a sample, a fuckin' snippet (snip it), like scissors do
Now when I hit the booth, I figure the days are over when I was quick
This fool used to fly off the handle like a fuckin' witch's broom
I called it pluckin' flowers 'cause I was so quick to pick a tool up (click-click)
Like it's petunia, sick medulla, but thanks to Cool J, he created a monster (what? Yeah)
Spaghetti sauce and mozzarella on a tray full of pasta (what?)
You got a couple of motherfuckin' trained killers-on-ya (lasagna)
And I'm just bein' as frank as Sinatra (haha)
When I be sayin' that I'ma keep this shit gangster as mobsters (what?)
But when you got fanatics goin' so crazy, they mob ya
Lookin' like organized crime because you can't get 'em-off-ya (mafia)
And all your motherfuckin' enemies, they wanna off ya, like Hoffa
And dump your body in Lake Minnetonka (shh)
That's how you know you fuckin' saw, and you came, and you conquered
Veni Vidi Vici, stompin' 'em, makin' 'em bonkers
Now women treat me like BDK (Big Daddy Kane), the king, and they feed me grapes (yeah)
Either way, I got more on my plate than an all you can eat buffet (woo)
So better pick a B.C. date 'cause your history is shady (yeah)
As they 'bout to set it on you like a TV tray (yup)
Man, I see the way people say I'm so evil (what?)
They fuckin' think that Timothy McVeigh and my DNA are exactly the same
But when I leave this game (nope)
Things just ain't gonna be the same (nah)
But it's in need of change (yeah), and I'm the meter maid (haha)
Go ahead and crack a bottle, 'cause this is E and J
Meanin' me and James (yeah), got that avocado
We the sociopaths, and we got your ho on our laps
And we're goin' back to Cali so she can blow on our sax
Brang-brang, brr-brr-brr-brrr, brr-brring
I don't think so
