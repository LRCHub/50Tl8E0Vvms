```lrc
[00:05.58] Do you remember first time you heard the legend in leather?
[00:07.57] The career ender with the road-killer stuck to his fender
[00:09.64] I'm on another bender, drunk off the power
[00:11.77] That make a coward surrender as I devour contenders
[00:13.85] Talkin' foul of whoever, your head is 'bout to get severed
[00:16.15] Then I bounce it with pleasure, I'm pouring out Amaretto
[00:18.51] Homies, I won't forgеt 'em, so tap the bottle and pour it
[00:20.66] Supermodels I ignore 'em, later on it's like porn
[00:23.12] Reincarnation of the Ripper, I give stitches and chest zippers
[00:25.48] Cinderella's get propellered out their glass slippers
[00:27.94] Time is tickin', giving ass whoppin's how we keep the cash flippin'
[00:30.69] What? A supa-dupa switch up (What?)
[00:32.92] I can't understand a single word you're saying
[00:34.35] I think you have syrup brain, 'bout to finish you like polyurethane
[00:36.93] All that molly probably sure to drain
[00:38.72] Your spinal fluid from your vertebrae
[00:39.86] This the Murdergram and I brought my murder gang
[00:41.67] My shit fire, that is why you log on it like Duraflame
[00:43.45] But as far as boulevards
[00:45.02] I'm talking 'bout Farmers like insurance claims (Pff!)
[00:46.27] I just blew your girl away, but she on so much blow and lean (What?)
[00:48.62] I call that fucking ho Katrina
[00:49.99] Somebody better give her-a-cane (Hurricane)
[00:50.93] And that's on everything (What?), she love my heavy chain
[00:52.62] My yellow diamond shining, got her whipping like lemon meringue
[00:55.47] Stripping in front of the gang, she's slipping inside of the Range
[00:57.89] Quick to go out with a bang, it's like I threw out a grenade
[01:00.20] Once you pull up in this, when the killing will begin
[01:02.11] You feel me pulling off your skin, I really came to get it and deliver
[01:04.42] Murdergrams, turn over your ambulance, thirty bullets in advance
[01:07.52] Candlelight and crying fans, we go in and buy a land
[01:09.41] Slide up behind you, testing my rifle
[01:11.70] Give blessings to my disciples, professional I'm a sniper
[01:13.67] Like eight miles away, me and Marshall doing murders
[01:15.96] With dirty burners, break them down and melt them in the furnace
[01:18.35] Unapologetic and we're gonna cause a headache
[01:20.52] Me and L about to set it, we about to murdergram it
[01:22.98] Anyone of y'all can get it, so you might as well forget it
[01:25.22] Either way you will regret it, cemetery's where you're headed
[01:27.53] Come on! (Yeah)
[01:28.75] The message in the chorus, you bastards got nothing for us
[01:29.85] The overlord is the rawest, I ain't talkin' 'bout a rental car
[01:32.02] When I'm pullin' the Taurus, this Halloween
[01:33.76] Them candy bars'll get you killed in the forest
[01:35.18] We are lyrically lawless, stackin' money, hoarders
[01:37.03] Slugs that make you forget all that slick-ass shit that you thought of
[01:40.16] Blow your mind with the sawed off
[01:41.45] Just when you thought it was safe, we bustin' at you from the Wraith
[01:43.80] They hittin' the door in, ain't nothin' sweet when we come in to play
[01:45.92] When I say that you ain't fuckin' with moi (-Mwah!)
[01:47.76] I do not mean kisses, boo, but I got the potential to
[01:48.87] Fuckin' flip what I mention with a pinching tool (What?)
[01:50.65] Come back with vengeance like Jack the Ripper
[01:51.96] To rip it, just givin' you a sample
[01:53.10] A fuckin' snippet (Snip it!), like scissors do
[01:54.77] Now when I hit the booth, I figure the days are over when I was quick
[01:56.13] This fool used to fly off the handle like a fuckin' witch's broom
[01:57.41] I called it pluckin' flowers
[01:59.68] 'Cause I was so quick to pick a tool up (Click-click)
[02:01.26] Like it's petunia, sick medulla
[02:02.93] But thanks to Cool J, he created a monster (What? Yeah)
[02:04.91] Spaghetti sauce and mozzarella on a tray full of pasta (What?)
[02:06.76] You got a couple of motherfuckin' trained killers-on-ya (Lasagna)
[02:09.42] And I'm just bein' as frank as Sinatra (Haha)
[02:11.78] When I be sayin' that I'ma keep this shit gangster as mobsters (What?)
[02:14.02] But when you got fanatics goin' so crazy, they mob ya
[02:16.07] Lookin' like organized crime because you can't get 'em-off-ya (Mafia!)
[02:18.59] And all your motherfuckin' enemies, they wanna off ya, like Hoffa
[02:21.49] And dump your body in Lake Minnetonka (Shhh)
[02:23.17] That's how you know you fuckin' saw, and you came, and you conquered
[02:24.90] Veni Vidi Vici, stompin' 'em, makin' 'em bonkers
[02:27.53] Now women treat me like BDK (Big Daddy Kane!)
[02:29.31] The king, and they feed me grapes (Yeah)
[02:31.01] Either way-
[02:32.88] I got more on my plate than an all you can eat buffet (Woo!)
[02:33.30] So better pick a B.C. date 'cause your history is shady (Yeah)
[02:33.95] As they 'bout to set it on you like a TV tray (Yup)
[02:36.45] Man, I see the way people say I'm so evil (What?)
[02:37.75] They fuckin' think that Timothy McVeigh and my DNA
[02:39.05] Are exactly the same
[02:40.48] But when I leave this game (Nope)
[02:41.52] Things just ain't gonna be the same (Nah)
[02:42.52] But it's in need of change (Yeah), and I'm the meter maid (Haha)
[02:44.03] Go ahead and crack a bottle, 'cause this is E and J
[02:45.98] Meaning me and James (Yeah), got that avocado
[02:48.33] We the sociopaths, and we got your ho on our laps
[02:51.71] And we're goin' back to Cali so she can blow on our sax (-sacks)
